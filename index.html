    <h2>completion is a social construct. not everything needs an ending.</h2>
    <p>This site is a digital notebook of sorts. A space where thoughts, half-proofs, and questions are allowed to remain unfinished.</p>
    <p><b>Inside:</b> unfinished ideas in mathematics, computer science, and philosophy.</p>
    <p><b>Bonus:</b> the Handwritten Letter Project.</p>
    <p>Unpolished and unconcerned with the illusion of completion.</p>
